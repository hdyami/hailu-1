# Your task
   
A client wants to build a site where he exposes content via an XML feed.
   
* Create a Drupal site and include it into the repository.
* Create an architecture which exposes the list of the basic Drupal Article content as an XML feed
* Protect the XML feed so that it can only be accessed by authorised third parties.
* Describe the chosen approach and contributed modules used in the README file.
* Commit any work you need to make the site operational.
* Do not commit a database into the repository. The site should work with devel_generate.
* The output of this task will likely include feature modules and an architecture description.
* If you have questions, file issues against this repository.
